Assignment for Software Test and Automation course from school

How can I ensure that my code, program or software is funcitonal and secure?

  The best way to confirm this is to run your code through tests that confirm that it meets the requirements of the program, run as expected, and are functional. Another great way to test this is to run it through static testing methods such as through a dependency check to confirm if there are known vulnerabilities.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
  One of the ways that I determine user needs is to first read through the requirements of the application. I then like to ask others on my team if they believe that my thoughts are the same as theirs. It is important to get feedback from others for confirmation. The way to incorporate user requirements is to write out a plan in the form of a summary and reflection report. This helps to organize the thoughts without over planning the development of the program.
  
How do I approach designing software?

  The way that I approach designing software is to first make sure that all requirements of the product are met. It is important that the requirements of a project are met by the code that is written. I then like to validate this through testing and making sure that the code is efficient. Fast and efficient code pushes it through testing and later implementation faster so that it meets the cost constraints of the project.
